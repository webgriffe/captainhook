### 1. Prevent forced push on protected branches

For example, you can prevent forced push on `master` branch with the following CaptainHook's config:

```json
    // captainhook.json
    // ...
    "pre-push": {
        "enabled": true,
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "\\Webgriffe\\CaptainHook\\PreventPushForce",
                "options": {"protected-branches": ["master"]}
            }
        ]
    }
    // ...
```

You can use the `protected-branches` option to add other branches to the protected branches list.
